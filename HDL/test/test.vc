# Unlike, say, VCS, in Modelsim .vc files reference relative to
# the compilation directory, and not the .vc's location directory.
# So all .vc files are defined in the same directory as this top
# level file, rather than (more preferably) local to the files
# they reference, to avoid confusion and make porting to other
# simulators easier.
